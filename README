Description
===========

dupes is an utility that can be used to find duplicate files. It does so by
computing a digest (currently MD5) for each file and stores it in a SQLite3
database.

This database can later be queried for finding duplicate files.


Building
========

This project uses autoconf & friends as its build toolchain. Building it should
be trivial once the GNU autoconf toolchain is installed.

If you have forked the code from github you will need to run the autoconf
programs in order to prepare build toolchain:

	./autogen.sh

Once the toolchain scripts are created simply build the program with:

	./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install

You should now be able to execute the program dupes!


Usage
=====

The progam is started from the command line and takes its parameters from the
command line. It expects to receive as input the files or folders to index.

	dupes /etc
